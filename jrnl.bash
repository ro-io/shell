#        1.  Creates a directory if it doesn't exist to store files
#        2.  Creates sub-directories if it doesn't exist based around
#          the current year and month.
#        3.  Creates a text file if it doesn't exist already named after the
#          current date.
#        4.  Populates said text file with a filled out template:
#                               /--------------------------/
#                               |       Month XX, 20XX     |
#                               |                          |
#                               | .......entry starts..... |
#        5.  Opens said text file in a text editor to finish the entry.
